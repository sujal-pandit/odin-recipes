    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Red Chillies</li>
        <li>Cinammon</li>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium skillet, combine red chiles, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, fennel, peppercorns, and cumin. Toast
            over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until fragrant and a shade darker in color, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>

            each.</li>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat ghee. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally,
            until softened and beginning to brown around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir to combine, then stir in spice blend, torn tomatoes with their
            juices, and milk. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is
            cooked through and sauce has thickened</li>
    </ol>
